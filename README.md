# Assuie Eats

# How to get it run? 
  - you need to have the Expo application on mobile or you can just use the localhost
  - you will need to cd AussieEat, cd forntend, npm run
  - Let it run for a while until it shows the QR code or the localhost port
  - 1. Scan the QR code on from and jumps to the Expo app
       - if it didn't work you need to make sure that both your phone and laptop are on the same network
  - 2. If you are using the port, copy past the port to a browser and you are done
   
  - When editing the files everyone needs to first push into a sub branch before the main branch


# Programming and Tool we will be using : 
  React Native + Expo  for forntend 
  Express js or js for backend 
  Firebase for database
